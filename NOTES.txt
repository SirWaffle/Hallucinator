pooling method seems to do squares only, and hit a max resolution of size x size blocks
	also doesnt seem to make much difference with number of cuts at all, think it just slows it down...


original does a much better job at high resilutions and getting details
	number of cuts makes a difference here, seems more detail with more cuts.
