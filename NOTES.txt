pooling method seems to do squares only, and hit a max resolution of size x size blocks
	also doesnt seem to make much difference with number of cuts at all, think it just slows it down...


original does a much better job at high resilutions and getting details
	number of cuts makes a difference here, seems more detail with more cuts. 






disabling grad on the clip perceptor image encode causes the network to not train
disabling grad on vectorquantize sets tensor to not having grad enabled




non deterministic:
adaptive_max_pool2d_backward_cuda  -> used by pooling

upsample_bicubic2d_backward_out_cuda -> where is this from now...
