Various things that need to be done, yes I'm too lazy to use a ticket tracking system for this:

- search for #TODO or # TODO for spots in code with notes


NOTES:
- torch transforms are faster, but dont seem to work out as well as the kornia augmentations
- look at ascend, and see if we really want a sum of errors when using multiple prompts...  ( changed to sum of squares )


TODOs:
- clean up how we modify the genJob from commands.. its hackinsh and terrible

- make masked prompt thing work, clean up the masked prompt stuff in GenerateJob

- look at nvidias torch-tensorRT for speed gains

- fix the horrible constructors i made to get rid of global variable dependency on argparse things

- refactor more, to clean up the wreckage of code. think about making a seperate generation job for spatial stuff, 
    and moving some things from the hallucinator class into generation job, just...clean everything now that its sorted better

- change how the image modifications that change the actual image being fed into the taming-transformers network get done  
    so that its possible to do multiple in the same frame, and only re-encode & recreate the optimizers once

- pop off mods as they are finished, to reduce iterations

- profile this thing to get more speed, must go faster


DONE:  
- dont rely on argparse stuff across classes
